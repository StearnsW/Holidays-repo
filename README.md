README for Holidays-repo
The purpose of this repository is to be a backup storage space as well as an easy 
external access point for William Stearns' Dev-10 Data Cohort Module 7 Assessment.
Included in this repository are the following files:
README.md (this file)
holidays queries.http
    An http file used during the coding phase to get a readout of the
    http soup returned by the websites to be scraped.
holidays.json
    A started json file used by the code containing a few holidays to initially
    populate the list to be built with.
project starter code.py
    A python file containing a beginning structure for the proposed project
    code that is the foundation for the (holidays project code).
weather json exploration.docx
    A word document used during the coding phase to get a readout of the
    json soup copied from a printout in the python, inserted line breaks to
    improve readability and understanding.
holidays project code.py
    A python file containing the final product code, began as a copy of the
    project starter code with the suggested notes from the comments filled in.
    
    When run, displays a series of output menus that take the user through the
    process of viewing and editing a preconstructed list of holidays from the
    holidays.json file as well as scraped from the site:
    https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/.  Should be fairly intuitive if
    user follows the various menus' directions

This is a project repository for a class, please do not edit its contents before
12/12/23 so the creator's work can be properly assessed.
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR OTHER GRADED WORK, I do not want to be responsible
for you doing poorly if this code is not well received
if you'd like it for personal or commercial purposes (I would be shocked,
but you do you) feel free.
