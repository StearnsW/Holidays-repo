README for Holidays-repo

The purpose of this repository is to be a backup storage space as well as an easy 
external access point for William Stearns' Dev-10 Data Cohort Module 7 Assessment
due 4/17/22.

Included in this repository are the following files:

README.md (this file)

holidays queries.http
    
    An http file used during the coding phase to get a readout of the
    http soup returned by the websites to be scraped.

holidays.json
    
    A started json file used by the code containing a few holidays to initially
    populate the list to be built with.

holidays saved.json

    A json file made from saving the initialized holiday list, as proof of ability
    to save worked upon data to json file. (What other saves are called is left
    up to the user, tries to keep from overwriting holidays.json)
    
project starter code.py
    
    A python file containing a beginning structure for the proposed project
    code that is the foundation for the (holidays project code).

weather json exploration.docx

    A word document used during the coding phase to get a readout of the
    json soup copied from a printout in the python, inserted line breaks to
    improve readability and understanding.

holidays project code.py
    
    A python file containing the final product code, began as a copy of the
    project starter code with the suggested notes from the comments filled in.
    
    When run, displays a series of output menus that take the user through the
    process of viewing and editing a preconstructed list of holidays from the
    holidays.json file as well as scraped from the site:
    https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/.  Should be fairly intuitive if
    user follows the various menus' directions

This is a project repository for a class, please do not edit its contents before
12/12/23 so the creator's work can be properly assessed.

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR OTHER GRADED WORK, I do not want to be responsible
for you doing poorly if this code is not well received.

If you'd like it for personal or commercial purposes feel free (I would be shocked,
but you do you).
